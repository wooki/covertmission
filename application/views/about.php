            <p>You will be set up to five missions to try and rid the galaxy of the Rebel Alliance.</p>

            <p>Each mission will have a team leader who selects the mission team.  Missions have different
            team sizes.  If the mission team is not approved by a majority then a new mission leader is
            selected and may pick a new team.</p>

            <p>Note that five rejected teams in a row will automatically lead to a win to the Rebel Spies.</p>

            <p>If the
            mission team is approved then the Imperial operatives will attempt
            to complete the mission. Rebel Spies will try to saboutage the mission. This is done simply by
            voting for mission success or failure.</p>

            <p>The first side to win three missions wins the game. Good luck!</p>
